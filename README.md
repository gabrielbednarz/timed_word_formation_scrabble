# Timed word formation Scrabble


There are 98 letters, and 2 players each receive 7 letters, with the number of rounds varying based on time management. 
For every move, each player can allocate up to x seconds from the total chosen time. The allocated seconds will be subtracted 
from the total time, regardless of whether they are used fully or not. Before allocating your time, you will see your letters 
and the number of possible n-letter words (2 <= n <= 7) that can be formed.
